 implementations of a stack and a queue using Visual Basic (VB):

### Stack Implementation

```vb
Module StackModule
    Class Node
        Public Data As Integer
        Public [Next] As Node

        Public Sub New(data As Integer)
            Me.Data = data
            Me.Next = Nothing
        End Sub
    End Class

    Class Stack
        Private top As Node

        Public Sub Push(data As Integer)
            Dim newNode As New Node(data)
            If top IsNot Nothing Then
                newNode.Next = top
            End If
            top = newNode
        End Sub

        Public Function Pop() As Integer
            If top Is Nothing Then
                Throw New InvalidOperationException("Stack is empty")
            End If
            Dim poppedValue As Integer = top.Data
            top = top.Next
            Return poppedValue
        End Function

        Public Function Peek() As Integer
            If top Is Nothing Then
                Throw New InvalidOperationException("Stack is empty")
            End If
            Return top.Data
        End Function

        Public Function IsEmpty() As Boolean
            Return top Is Nothing
        End Function

        Public Sub Display()
            Dim temp As Node = top
            While temp IsNot Nothing
                Console.Write(temp.Data & " ")
                temp = temp.Next
            End While
            Console.WriteLine()
        End Sub
    End Class

    Sub Main()
        Dim stack As New Stack()
        stack.Push(1)
        stack.Push(2)
        stack.Push(3)
        stack.Display()
        Console.WriteLine("Popped: " & stack.Pop())
        stack.Display()
    End Sub
End Module
```

### Queue Implementation

```vb
Module QueueModule
    Class Node
        Public Data As Integer
        Public [Next] As Node

        Public Sub New(data As Integer)
            Me.Data = data
            Me.Next = Nothing
        End Sub
    End Class

    Class Queue
        Private front As Node
        Private rear As Node

        Public Sub Enqueue(data As Integer)
            Dim newNode As New Node(data)
            If rear Is Nothing Then
                front = newNode
                rear = newNode
            Else
                rear.Next = newNode
                rear = newNode
            End If
        End Sub

        Public Function Dequeue() As Integer
            If front Is Nothing Then
                Throw New InvalidOperationException("Queue is empty")
            End If
            Dim dequeuedValue As Integer = front.Data
            front = front.Next
            If front Is Nothing Then
                rear = Nothing
            End If
            Return dequeuedValue
        End Function

        Public Function Peek() As Integer
            If front Is Nothing Then
                Throw New InvalidOperationException("Queue is empty")
            End If
            Return front.Data
        End Function

        Public Function IsEmpty() As Boolean
            Return front Is Nothing
        End Function

        Public Sub Display()
            Dim temp As Node = front
            While temp IsNot Nothing
                Console.Write(temp.Data & " ")
                temp = temp.Next
            End While
            Console.WriteLine()
        End Sub
    End Class

    Sub Main()
        Dim queue As New Queue()
        queue.Enqueue(1)
        queue.Enqueue(2)
        queue.Enqueue(3)
        queue.Display()
        Console.WriteLine("Dequeued: " & queue.Dequeue())
        queue.Display()
    End Sub
End Module
```

These implementations of a stack and a queue in Visual Basic use linked lists to manage the elements. The `Stack` class includes methods to push, pop, peek, check if the stack is empty, and display the elements. The `Queue` class includes methods to enqueue, dequeue, peek, check if the queue is empty, and display the elements.
